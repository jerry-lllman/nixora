# Exports

This directory will hold generated campaign projects produced by the Studio publish pipeline.
Each publish operation is expected to emit a standalone project (for example a Next.js
application) that can be deployed independently of the core monorepo apps. Artifacts can be
versioned, previewed, or promoted through deployment workflows from here.
